# compas_cloud
compas_cloud is the further development of `compas.rpc` module. It uses websocktes instead of RESTful APIs to allow bi-directional communications between various front-end programs like Rhino, GH, RhinoVault2, blender or web-based viewers that are implemented in different enviroments including CPython, IronPython and Javascript. It also allows to save certain variables to backend inside a user session to avoid overheads created by redundant data transfers.
